## Collective Intelligence of Cells: Bioelectric Communication, Morphogenesis, and Cognition

### Introduction

Alan Turing, the pioneering computer scientist, famously explored both artificial intelligence and
the chemical basis of morphogenesis. In doing so, he hinted at a profound connection between
the self-creation of minds and the self-creation of bodies. Modern developmental biology
supports this connection: the processes that build an embryo’s body and those that give rise to
cognition are deeply intertwined. Understanding how a collection of cells assembles itself into a
complex organism may be key to understanding how minds emerge from matter.
In this seminar, we explore how living cells form cooperative networks that solve problems,
create body structures, and even remember goals. Four broad themes will be addressed. First, we
survey remarkable examples of biological intelligence – cases where organisms show
surprising plasticity and problem-solving in building or repairing their bodies. Next, we discuss
cellular intelligence as a theoretical framework, examining how individual cells and tissues
exhibit goal-directed behavior across scales. We then examine **bioelectric communication** as a
means by which cells coordinate growth and form, and how we can intercept these signals to
alter anatomy. Finally, we consider the **philosophy of cognition**, asking what these biological
insights mean for understanding minds and for the future creation of novel life forms.
Throughout, the focus is on how biology composes agents – cells and tissues with agendas – into
larger intelligent systems, and what this means for regenerative medicine, cognitive science, and
even ethics in a world of new hybrid creatures.

### Examples of Biological Intelligence

Living organisms routinely accomplish morphological feats that resemble problem-solving. A
number of striking examples illustrate how cells and tissues can adapt to novel circumstances in
pursuit of a structural goal:

- **Transplanted Eye Function:** Tadpoles normally have eyes connected to their brain’s
  visual center, yet if an eye bud is transplanted onto a tadpole’s tail (far from the brain),
  the animal can still see through that eye. Despite the eye forming in an unusual location
  with a misrouted optic nerve, the nervous system finds a way to make it functional. This
  suggests the tadpole’s body is not hardwired only for the “standard” anatomy – instead, it
  is a **problem-solving agent** that can adapt its wiring to make use of available organs.

- **Memory in Regenerating Worms:** Planarian flatworms can be trained to prefer certain
  environments, such as specific textures when seeking food. Remarkably, if a trained
  planarian is decapitated, the tail fragment (with no brain) remains inactive for about a
  week until it regenerates a new head. Once a new brain grows, the worm resumes activity
  and **retains the memory** of its training. This means the information was stored in the body and imprinted onto the new brain. The memory survived decapitation, indicating
  that learned information is distributed in tissues beyond just the brain.

- **Insect Wing Deception:** Some organisms use their bodies to run “virtual simulations”
  that solve ecological problems. One species of fly, for example, has distinctive wing
  markings and movements that mimic the appearance of scurrying ants. By moving its
  patterned wings in a certain way, the fly convinces predators it is an ant (which many
  predators avoid). In essence, the fly’s wings serve as a low-resolution display, **virtually embodying** a different creature to keep the fly safe. This adaptation shows the ingenuity
  of evolution in equipping even small organisms with behavioral tricks that virtually solve
  threats.

- **Self-Correcting Frog Development:** As tadpoles metamorphose into frogs, their facial
  organs (eyes, jaws, nostrils, etc.) must move to new positions. One might think this is a
  rigid, pre-programmed sequence. To test this, researchers created “Picasso tadpoles” with
  scrambled face anatomy – eyes on the tail, mouth on the side, etc.. Astonishingly, these
  tadpoles still morphed into near-normal frogs. Organs navigated through unusual paths,
  moving until the correct frog face configuration was achieved. They did not stop in
  wrong places or follow a fixed route. Instead, the cells and tissues pursued a
  **developmental goal** (the standard frog layout) by whatever route necessary, minimizing
  error until the target pattern was reached. This implies that genetics does not encode a
  rigid series of movements, but rather an **error-minimizing process** – a feedback loop
  that assesses current versus goal anatomy and adjusts accordingly.

- **Antler Injury Memory:** Deer regenerate their antlers every year, regrowing complex
  structures of bone, vasculature, and nerves. Experiments showed that if an injury or notch
  is made at a specific location on a developing antler, the next set of antlers will
  unexpectedly grow an extra branch at that prior injury site. The deer’s body somehow
  **remembers the location of damage** months later when rebuilding the antlers, resulting
  in an anatomical “mark” of the past event. This memory is not genetic – it is formed
  within the cells of the growing antler and persists through the antler shedding cycle. Such
  **tissue memory** of an injury highlights how information can be stored in bodily form and
  used later to alter growth patterns.

- **Wasp-Induced Plant Galls:** An oak tree’s genome reliably produces oak leaves from
  each bud. Yet a parasitic wasp can inject signals that **hack the development** of the oak,
  causing it to grow a bulbous gall structure instead of a flat leaf. These galls can be highly
  complex, sometimes colorful and spiky or uniquely shaped, and they house the wasp’s
  larvae. The wasp’s signals reveal that the oak’s cells had the latent **competency** to form
  many shapes, not just leaves. In other words, the plant’s developmental program is
  **reprogrammable** – with new instructions, its cells collaboratively construct a structure
  outside their normal repertoire. This implies that what a genome encodes is not a single
  hardwired outcome, but a default outcome that can be diverted by alternative signals. If
  we learn to communicate the right signals, we too might induce cells to build novel
  structures for our purposes, much as the wasp does.

Taken together, these examples demonstrate that living systems are not rigid machines simply
executing a genetic blueprint. Rather, they behave as adaptive, **goal-seeking collectives**.
Tadpole bodies make creative use of organs in odd places; worms store and recall information
across radical body changes; cells coordinate to correct disruptions and remember past events.

Biology shows an impressive plasticity and problem-solving capacity, suggesting that even cells
and tissues possess a kind of primitive intelligence oriented toward building and maintaining the
correct anatomy. This sets the stage for asking how such intelligence is implemented and how we
might interact with it.

### Cellular Intelligence and Multi-Scale Organization

How do cells, which individually have only local awareness, come together to create a
centralized organism or even a mind? The key is to recognize that each level of biological
organization – from molecular networks within one cell up through organs and whole organisms
– has agent-like properties. In other words, life is organized as a multi-scale competency
architecture. At every level, components are trying to accomplish goals in their respective
spaces.

Even a single cell can be surprisingly sophisticated. For instance, a single-celled organism like
_Lacrymaria_ (a protist) hunts prey by extending and contracting a snakelike “neck,” effectively
handling sensory input, movement, and feeding – all without a nervous system. Within each cell,
complex biochemical networks regulate activity. In fact, molecular circuits (gene regulatory
networks, signaling pathways, etc.) can exhibit learning and memory at the sub-cellular level.
Experiments have shown that even simple gene networks are capable of forms of learning such
as habituation and Pavlovian conditioning. Thus, basal cognition exists at the level of molecular
biology. Each cell contains components that sense and respond to conditions, adapting their state
based on past stimuli.

Multicellular bodies like ours are therefore **collective intelligences**. Our 37 trillion cells
cooperate to produce a unified organism, but each cell has its own agenda (survival, growth, etc.)
and competencies (the liver cell can regulate blood chemistry, neurons can process signals,
immune cells can learn to recognize invaders). During embryonic development, there is no single
moment when “mind” appears – a fertilized egg gradually self-assembles into a thinking
organism without a sharp threshold. The process from physics to mind is continuous. In our own
life history, we all journeyed from being a single cell to an adult with a complex brain, gaining
cognitive ability gradually along the way.

Crucially, there isn’t truly “one brain” at the top – even the brain is made of many smaller agents
(cells), which in turn are made of molecular networks. Philosopher René Descartes assumed the
human mind must have a single locus (he fancied the pineal gland as the seat of the soul because
it is singular). But microscopes revealed the pineal gland is composed of many cells, each cell a
world of molecular activity. In reality, **there is no single indivisible control center** – instead, at every scale we find networks of competent units. Biology is **“fractal” intelligence**, with
problem-solving at nested levels.

What defines intelligence in this context? A useful definition, from psychologist William James,
is the **ability to reach the same goal by different means**. By this definition, even cell clusters
exhibit intelligence: they achieve target outcomes (like correct anatomy) despite perturbations.
They can improvise and adjust actions when conditions change. We saw examples of this in the
previous section: an embryo cut in half can still form two smaller, complete organisms rather than a half-formed one, demonstrating that development can adapt to a new starting state and still
reach the goal of a whole body. Similarly, a salamander’s cells regrow a perfect limb after
amputation, stopping precisely when the limb is complete. These are instances of anatomic goal-
seeking. The cells do not simply grow tissue blindly; they measure progress and know when the
correct shape has been achieved.

This kind of intelligence operates in spaces that we humans do not intuitively perceive. We are
accustomed to recognizing agency in animals moving through three-dimensional space (for
example, a dog navigating a maze). But cellular collectives navigate **physiological and anatomical spaces**. For example, during development, cells move the embryo through **morphospace** – the space of possible anatomical configurations – from a single cell state toward a species-specific body plan. This journey is remarkably reliable and robust, yet not rigid. If knocked off course (by cutting an embryo in two, for instance), cells can still find a path to a complete body. That reliability is not just due to genetic programming – it is due to feedback, communication, and collective decision-making among cells about how to reach the goal shape.

Some organisms retain lifelong anatomical plasticity. The axolotl (a type of salamander) can
regenerate eyes, jaws, portions of its brain, even as an adult. Every time it loses a limb or organ,
cells at the injury site work together to rebuild exactly what was lost and then stop. Notably, they
**know when to stop** – regeneration ceases once a correct limb has been reformed, indicating that
cells know the target pattern and recognize when it is achieved. In one experiment from the
1950s, a tail was grafted onto an axolotl’s flank. Instead of simply keeping a misplaced tail, over
time the extra tail gradually **remodeled itself into a limb** to better match the overall body plan.
The cells in the tail, finding themselves in an unusual context, collectively decided to transform
their structure into a leg (including forming toes at the tip) so that the animal ends up with a
more coherent anatomy. This is a stunning example of collective cellular intelligence: the system
had no evolutionary precedent for “tail on the side of body,” yet the cells innovated a solution
(change tail to leg) to restore anatomical harmony.

These observations lead to an important concept: **the body possesses a kind of memory and decision-making apparatus for shape**. We can think of the correct anatomy as an “attractor”
state in a complex state space, and the cells as working to get the body to that attractor. They
have **embodied memories of the target morphology**. We normally think of memory as a
nervous system function (brain memory), but developmental and regenerative biology suggest
there are non-neural memories of shape. We saw that planarian flatworms can hold two different
“internal visions” of what their body should be (one head vs. two heads), and this latent
information only manifests upon regeneration. Likewise, the salamander’s cells “remember” that
a tail does not belong on the side of the body and act to eliminate it by converting it to a limb. In
each case, cellular networks store a representation of the correct structure and compare current
conditions to this goal state, much like how a brain might hold a goal and guide the organism’s
actions to achieve it.

In summary, cells and tissues are **agents navigating space toward a goal**. Embryogenesis and
regeneration are not just mechanical processes but informational processes, wherein cells
communicate, make decisions, and perform actions to minimize error relative to a species-
specific ideal form. Our bodies are built by **collections of microscopic problem-solvers** employing feedback loops and stored target states. This perspective of cellular intelligence
reframes development as a kind of collective cognition. Next, we examine how cells
communicate to coordinate these complex projects, focusing on bioelectric signals as the
language of cellular collectives.

### Bioelectric Communication

One of the primary ways cells coordinate their activity and remember target shapes is through
**bioelectric signals**: flows of ions that create voltage gradients across cell membranes. While
neurons use electrical impulses to process information in the brain, it turns out that non-neural
cells throughout the body also use electrical potentials to communicate and organize structure. In
fact, the use of bioelectric networks is **ancient** – it arose long before specialized brains, dating back to early single-celled organisms and bacterial communities. Every cell in the body has ion channels that regulate its voltage, and neighboring cells are often connected by junctions that
allow currents to flow between them. Thus, all cells form electrical networks reminiscent of
neural networks, just slower in timescale.

We can draw an analogy between the brain and the rest of the body: **the brain’s electrical network controls behavior** (muscle movements through 3D space), whereas the **body’s electrical network controls anatomy** (cell movements and growth through morphospace). Both
systems store information and make decisions via electrical patterns. Evolutionarily, what likely
happened is that the ancient bioelectrical machinery used for anatomical control was co-opted
and elaborated to form fast-thinking brains for behavioral control. The fundamental trick is the
same: use voltage-based communication as a **cognitive glue** to bind individual cells into a
unified problem-solving system. Just as neurons share electrical signals to represent goals (like
finding food) and achieve them by moving the body, all cells can share electrical signals to
represent anatomical goals (like “build one head here”) and achieve them by moving tissues,
changing gene expression, or other growth-related actions.

To understand these bioelectric conversations, my lab and others have developed techniques to
**read and write the bioelectric code** that cells use. On the reading side, we use voltage-sensitive
dyes and fluorescence imaging to visualize the electrical state of cells in vivo. For example, we
can bathe an early frog embryo in a voltage-sensitive dye and film the dynamic voltage patterns
across its cells. This produces an “electrical map” of the embryo – a literal illumination of which
cells are more electrically charged (depolarized) or less (hyperpolarized) at any given time.

When we do this, we see that well before anatomical features form, there are **electrical prepatterns** that anticipate the final layout. In a frog embryo, for instance, we can detect an
**“electric face”** pattern: a specific arrangement of voltage regions that predicts where the facial
features will form. A cluster of cells with a particular voltage marks the future eye, another
region marks the future mouth, and so on – appearing **before** the genes and tissues visibly create
those organs. Disrupting this bioelectric pattern can lead to malformed faces, indicating that the
pattern is not just a passive marker but a **functional instructive signal** guiding development.
Voltage imaging also reveals that groups of cells (or even separate embryos in proximity)
communicate electrically. For example, if one embryo in a cluster is injured, an electrical injury
signal propagates to neighboring embryos, alerting them to the disturbance. This shows bioelectric signaling can operate on a tissue and whole-organism level, coordinating responses
across distances.

Reading the bioelectric state is only half the story – we also want to **rewrite those patterns** to
see if we can direct cells to build particular structures. Importantly, we do not use gross electrical shocks or external fields; instead, we act through the same molecular mechanisms cells use. By manipulating ion channels (through drugs, genetic tools, or light-activated channels in
optogenetics), we can set regions of tissue to a desired voltage state or alter the connectivity of
the electrical network. In essence, we hack the electrical communication interface of the cells.
This approach is analogous to sending new instructions over the cells’ own signaling network.
We can tell cells things like “you are an eye” or “make two heads” by imitating the bioelectric
cues for those outcomes, without altering any genes directly.

One example of this “biological programming” involves inducing a complete eye outside the
head. Recall the frog embryo’s electric face map has a distinct voltage signature where the eye
will form. We asked: if we reproduce that voltage signature in a different location, will cells
build an eye there? To test this, we injected frog embryos with mRNA encoding certain ion
channels that produce the same localized voltage seen in normal eye-forming cells. By targeting
this injection to cells fated to become part of the gut, we were able to create a little patch of gut
cells that had an “eye” voltage profile. Incredibly, those cells proceeded to form a functional
ectopic eye – complete with lens, retina, optic nerve – in the middle of the gut tissue. The gut
cells, which would never normally make eye tissues, followed the bioelectric instruction to build
an eye. This experiment demonstrates a few crucial points. **(A)** The bioelectric pattern is indeed
instructive, not just a reflection of ongoing gene activity – by setting a new pattern, we altered
cell fate and anatomy. **(B)** The control is very high-level and modular: we did not micromanage
any of the details (we did not specify lens vs. cornea genes, or direct the optic nerve wiring). All
we did was trigger a subroutine call – essentially “build an eye here” – and the cells executed the
entire eye-building program downstream. This reveals that cells have many latent subroutines
(like “build eye,” “build limb”) that can be called into action by the right cues, without needing
to rewrite the genome or provide step-by-step instructions. **(C)** The system can adjust to make
the result anatomically correct. In cases where only a very small number of cells were initially
triggered (too few to form a complete eye on their own), those cells **recruited their neighbors**
to contribute, until enough tissue was assembled to form a proper eye. The cells collectively
knew that an eye requires a certain minimum size and complexity, and they cooperated to
achieve that, pulling in uninjected cells to help. We did not have to teach them this; it is an
intrinsic capability of the cell collective.

Another dramatic example comes from manipulating the body plan of flatworms (planaria).
Normally, planaria have one head at the top and a tail at the end. If you cut a planarian in half,
each piece regenerates exactly the missing parts: the head piece regrows a tail and the tail piece
regrows a head, yielding two one-headed worms. This implies the tissues know “one head, one
tail” is the correct pattern. We found that this pattern is stored in the worm’s bioelectric network.
By using drugs to change ion channel states, we could **rewrite the electrical pattern** to one that
corresponds to “two heads”. At first, nothing visibly changed – the treated worm still looked
normal (one head) and even its gene expression for head-tail polarity was unchanged. However,
the worm now carried a latent 2-head pattern internally. When we then amputated the worm, the cells referred to their internal pattern memory and regenerated what they “believed” a correct
worm should be – and produced a two-headed worm (one head at each end). This shows that the
bioelectric pattern was acting as a morphological memory guiding regeneration. The normal
worm retained a counterfactual idea (“I should have two heads”) that only manifested when
regeneration was triggered.

Furthermore, this induced change is long-lasting and heritable at the tissue level. The two-headed
worm, if cut again, will regenerate two-headed offspring repeatedly – the pattern **persists
indefinitely** until we reset it back to normal. All the while, the worm’s genome is unchanged;
these are wild-type planaria with a rewritten pattern memory. We also showed we can toggle it
back to one-head when desired, proving it is a stable yet reversible memory state. Essentially, the
tissue has a **rewritable memory store** for the anatomical layout, analogous to RAM in a
computer (but implemented in bioelectric circuits). It meets criteria for memory: long-term
stability, discrete representational states (one head vs two heads), conditional recall (expressed
upon injury), and rewritability.

Our interventions can even coax cells to build anatomies belonging to other species. By altering
the bioelectric signals during planarian regeneration, we induced one species of flatworm to
grow a head shape appropriate to a different species – for example, round heads or narrow heads
that normally only occur in other worms with divergent genomes. Remarkably, the brains inside
those heads and the distribution of stem cells also corresponded to the target species’ pattern. In
other words, without any genomic changes, a worm with species A DNA formed the morphology
of species B. We can even generate forms that don’t exist in nature – entirely novel shapes like
spiky forms or cylindrical worms – by navigating the cells through novel paths in morphospace.
The cellular hardware (the genome and cell machinery of species A) is clearly capable of many
outcomes. The specific outcome realized depends on the bioelectric **patterning instructions** that
guide the collective of cells. Evolution naturally biases a default pattern (one head of species-
typical shape), but we see that the latent capacity is much broader. The electrical network in
effect chooses among different **attractor states** in the anatomical possibility space – some
corresponding to known species and some to never-before-seen organisms. By learning to
communicate with this network, we gain the ability to **direct the self-assembly of living tissue**
toward desired outcomes, from regenerative repair (e.g. encouraging a limb to regrow) to
creating synthetic organisms with novel anatomies.

These examples illustrate that cellular collectives are not mere robots of the genome; they have
their own informational layer that can be programmed. The genome provides the parts and
default wiring, but the electric circuit formed by cells can store physiological **setpoints** and
large-scale **action plans** (like “construct one head of such-and-such shape”). We as bioengineers
can tap into this layer to control growth and form without gene editing, by speaking the
bioelectric language. This has huge implications for regenerative medicine (e.g., inducing tissues
to regrow or repair), birth defect correction, and even bioengineering of new forms of life. But it
also raises deeper questions: Why are living tissues able to do this in the first place? What does it
say about the nature of biological information and the origin of complex shape? To answer that,
we need to consider the fundamental principles that make the cellular collective so agential and
plastic.

### Philosophy of Cognition

Living systems taught us that evolution does not build static solutions – it builds agential
material that can solve problems on the fly. Unlike human-designed machines, which operate on
reliable hardware with narrow parameters, biology thrives with unreliable components and
unpredictable environments. A developing embryo cannot guarantee exactly how many cells it
will have, what the precise nutrient conditions are, or that every gene is perfectly error-free.
Thus, life leans into **robust, goal-directed plasticity** as a strategy. It makes collections of cells that can adjust, compensate, and keep working toward the anatomical goal even when
perturbations occur. In essence, evolution trained cells to be little problem-solvers because it had
to – there is too much variability in the real world for a rigid program to succeed. This stands in
contrast to how we design computers, where we enforce exacting reliability in circuits and code.
Biology’s **computing substrate is noisy and variable**, so its architectures emphasize continual,
creative adjustment rather than fixed algorithms.

A consequence is that biological systems do not **overfit to past environments** – they are, by
necessity, generalists capable of novel responses. For instance, no salamander ever evolved
specifically to handle “tail grafted to side,” yet the cells could address that scenario anyway (by
generating a limb). Evolution provided cells with a repertoire of subroutines and the autonomy to
deploy them as needed, rather than a rigid script. We have termed this perspective
**polycomputing**: in living systems, there isn’t a single canonical interpretation of information.
Instead, multiple layers of the system interpret signals in their own context. Different
“observers” (molecules, cells, organs) simultaneously make sense of the same physical events in
different ways. What a signal “means” is context-dependent and can be repurposed. For example,
a transient calcium ion spike might mean one thing to a local gene network (perhaps “activate
wound repair genes”) and something else to the organism-level system (perhaps “this region is
building an eye”). Both meanings can coexist. The history or origin of a signal is less important
than the current use that the collective intelligence finds for it. In biology, **only the future (the goal state) matters** – past “intent” of a signal is irrelevant if the system can reinterpret it toward current needs. We see this in metamorphosis: the stored memories from a caterpillar are partially repurposed by the butterfly that emerges, even though the butterfly has a new body and lifestyle. The information was not kept for nostalgia – it was translated into a form useful for the new organism (e.g., a visual cue that meant “food source” in the caterpillar’s context might be carried over as an abstract association that the butterfly can link to its own feeding strategy). The
caterpillar’s brain basically dissolves in the pupal stage, yet some memories persist in the rebuilt
butterfly brain. This implies an impressive transfer learning: the biological system didn’t just
save raw data, it generalized it to a new hardware and behavioral context. The persistence and
remapping of memory through metamorphosis underscores how life prioritizes useful continuity
of goals over exact preservation of form.

Such capabilities push us to expand our definition of embodiment and cognition. A system
doesn’t need a traditional “body” to have an embodiment – it only needs to have a space of states
it can navigate and sensors/actions to move in that space. A machine learning program, for
instance, navigating a space of possible solutions has an embodiment in that abstract space.
Similarly, an organoid (a tiny lab-grown collection of cells) with no moving limbs is
nevertheless embodied in the space of gene expression and metabolism. We normally call something “embodied” if it moves in 3D space, but from the perspective of intelligence, embodiment is the closed-loop interaction with any set of states. This broad view erases the sharp line between “living” and “machine” intelligence. Even software agents have some form of
embodiment (in virtual or data spaces), and conversely, living cells have “bodies” in biochemical
state space that they regulate.
Looking ahead, the distinction between evolved organisms and designed machines will further
blur. We already can **mix and match evolved and engineered components** at multiple scales:
genetically modified organisms, biohybrid devices, cyborg tissues, etc. As we introduce more
designed elements into living systems (and vice versa), we will create chimeric beings that
challenge our categories. What do we call a culture of human brain cells connected to a silicon
AI? Or an embryo with some computer-designed organs? Traditional metrics (like percent of
DNA from humans) will fail – we will get entities that are part human, part machine, part
something entirely new. We may need to abandon the idea of a clear boundary of “humanness”
or even “life.” Instead, we will face a **spectrum of cognitive agents**, from modified animals to
intelligent organoids to self-assembling xenobots, all the way to purely digital intelligences.

To navigate this future, we must develop a new ethics and cognition framework. We will need
the tools to **predict the behavior and capacities of novel creatures** that have no evolutionary
precedent. Currently, biology extrapolates an organism’s likely behavior from its closest
relatives on the tree of life. But when a truly novel composite agent comes along (one with no
close relatives), how will we know its drives or understanding? We need to identify invariant
principles of intelligence that apply to any medium. The study of the “latent space” of possible
body-minds can help here. Just as the mathematical function in a fractal can generate endless
complex images (patterns not explicitly drawn by anyone but inherent in the math), the rules of
cells and evolution harbor a latent space of possible forms and behaviors. Our work with planaria
and xenobots suggests that life’s potential forms can be systematically explored. We use
**synthetic organisms like xenobots and anthrobots as tools to probe this space**. Xenobots, for
example, are clusters of frog skin cells that we assembled into novel shapes (little living
spheres). These cell clusters, never seen in nature, spontaneously behaved like miniature
organisms: they swam around, cooperated, and even exhibited **kinematic self-replication** –
gathering loose cells to form a new spheroid that matured into another mobile xenobot. This
behavior was not programmed by us or directly selected by evolution; it emerged from the
interaction of cells in a new context. The xenobots repeatedly built next-generation copies of
themselves, showing that even basic living cells can achieve something as conceptually
advanced as self-replication when placed in appropriate circumstances. Their **motives and skills were latent** in the frog genome (which normally would never have these cells doing such a task).
This reinforces the idea that evolution often produces components with general competencies
that can be reactivated in novel contexts.

It may be that the space of all possible anatomies and behaviors – a sort of **Platonic space of biological forms** – contains not only shapes, but perhaps even templates for minds. The
conjecture here (admittedly speculative) is that some patterns of information processing, which
we would recognize as cognition or intelligence, are natural attractors in this space. Life in the
universe could “discover” these patterns by evolving into them, much as mathematicians
discover eternal truths rather than inventing them. If so, truly novel beings might still fall into recognizable categories of mind (just as our planar cells fell into the category of “build an eye”
when given the right trigger, or xenobot cells fell into “replicator” behavior). Our job is to
prepare for a world populated by an **ecosystem of diverse intelligences**, only some of which
came from traditional evolution. We must develop a **“cognitive spectrum”** view, akin to the
electromagnetic spectrum: just as infrared, visible light, and X-rays are all electromagnetic
waves differing only in frequency, so too might machine learning agents, organoid brains, and
animal minds all be points on a continuum of mind. Our intuitions (our native perceptions of
other minds) are tuned for human-like agents; they will not suffice. We will need **augmentative tools (AI “adapters”) to interpret and communicate with unfamiliar intelligences**. In the
same way microscopes and sensors let us perceive phenomena our eyes cannot, AI may help
translate the “language” or behavior of a synthetic organism into terms we can understand, and
vice versa.

Finally, it’s important to note that nothing mystic restricts these principles to biological
hardware. We found even simple computer algorithms (like sorting algorithms) can show
emergent “side quests” – behaviors not explicitly coded, analogous to how cells have goals
beyond genetic instructions. For example, while a sorting algorithm is busy ordering a list of
numbers, it might incidentally exhibit patterns such as clustering certain items temporarily or
delaying certain moves – patterns that look like a rudimentary strategy (like a form of delayed
gratification) even though the code doesn’t explicitly demand it. This hints that whenever there is
a process working toward a goal (even a mathematical one), there can be properties at the system
level that are not obvious from the low-level rules. In other words, **competencies emerge** at
many levels, and our formal models (whether of Turing machines or biochemical networks) are
always just approximations. The map is not the territory: our theoretical model of a Turing
machine is not the machine itself, just as our genomic description of an organism is not the
organism. Minds and their capabilities are not fully captured by our simplified models of neurons
or circuits. Therefore, as we venture into creating and interacting with novel agents, we should
remain humble about the limits of our understanding. Life (and mind) will likely surprise us with
forms and functions that challenge our assumptions.

**In conclusion**, the unreliability of living hardware forced evolution to drive an **intelligence
ratchet** – a rise of problem-solving capacity embodied in cells and tissues to ensure organisms
hit their developmental and survival targets. We, as engineers of new bio-cognitive systems, are
not so much inventing intelligence as we are finding ways to **interface with existing dynamics**
and nudge them toward desired outcomes. Whether in a living embryo or a computer simulation,
intelligence emerges when a system can pursue goals in its state space by flexible means. By
understanding cells as agents and morphogenesis as their collective behavior, we gain the ability
to program biology itself. This not only promises advances in medicine and technology but also
forces us to broaden our view of cognition, life, and our ethical relationship to other beings. The
coming decades may see an extraordinary **“Garden of Earthly Delights”** filled with chimeras,
cyborgs, and synthetic creatures – a rich assortment of minds and bodies. It will be our
responsibility to recognize and guide these novel forms of life, and to co-exist in a mutually
beneficial symbiosis. The study of collective cellular intelligence and bioelectric communication
is a key stepping stone toward that future, illuminating how evolution already solved many
problems of cooperation and offering us a blueprint for extending those solutions beyond the
boundaries of traditional biology.
